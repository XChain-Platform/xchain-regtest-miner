 * bin/reachability.js used to declare two DYNAMIC_EDGES (src/consensus_rules_digest.js
 * and src/db/index.js) copied verbatim out of xchain-indexer's twin, neither of which
 * this repo has. edgesFrom() only applies a declared edge while it is walking the exact
 * file the edge names as `from`, so a `from` this repo never tracks is never visited and
 * the edge quietly applies zero times, while the summary still reported
 * `declared dynamic edges: 2`, confidence the tool had not earned. This suite drives the
 * fix: DYNAMIC_EDGES is empty because this repo has no computed require, and a future
 * stale declaration fails loudly instead of repeating the silent pass.
 *
 * Outside test/ on purpose, matching bin/test/suite_title_split_map.test.js: run it
 * directly.
