# Contributing to XChain Regtest Miner

Thanks for considering a contribution. `xchain-regtest-miner` is a development utility that auto-mines mempool transactions for regtest environments. It is not a production service, but correctness and safety still matter: a misconfigured miner pointed at the wrong network could have unintended consequences.

If you're reporting a security issue, **stop here** and read [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) instead. Security reports go through a private channel.

## Setting up

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22** exactly. The platform pins Node 22 fleet-wide: the `mariadb` driver used elsewhere in the platform is ESM-only (Node 18 fails with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`), and newer majors are not validated against the stack. `engines.node` declares `>=22.0.0`; use 22.
- A coin node (`bitcoind` / `litecoind` / `dogecoind`) running in **regtest mode** for integration and e2e runs. This service must not be pointed at mainnet or a value-bearing testnet.

### First-time install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XChain-platform/xchain-regtest-miner.git
cd xchain-regtest-miner
npm install
```

Create a `.env` (see [`README.md`](./README.md) for the full key list). **Never commit a `.env` or any real credential.** Secrets live only in the local `.env`, loaded at runtime; never hard-code them into source, tests, or scripts.

---

## Running it

```bash
npm run api        # start the miner and JSON-RPC API server
```

## Tests

The miner runs a layered suite. Pick the tier that matches your change:

| Tier | Command | Needs external services |
|---|---|---|
| Smoke | `npm run test:smoke` | No |
| Unit | `npm run test:unit` | No |
| Security | `npm run test:security` | No |
| CI (unit, fast gate) | `npm run ci` | No |
| Fuzz | `npm run test:fuzz` (`:quick` for 60s) | No |
| Chaos | `npm run test:chaos` | No |
| Performance | `npm run test:performance` | No |
| Regression T0 (critical) | `npm run test:regression:t0` | No |
| Regression T1 (standard) | `npm run test:regression:t1` | No |
| End-to-end | `npm run test:e2e` | bitcoind regtest |
| Regression T2 (full e2e) | `npm run test:regression:t2` | bitcoind regtest |

Run the no-external-services tiers before every commit; the README documents the full script catalogue. New API or mining logic should come with security test coverage, since the API surface accepts untrusted caller input.

## Coding style

- **Plain JavaScript**, no TypeScript. No ORM.
- **No linter is configured.** Match the style of the surrounding file: naming, structure, and comment density.
- **Comments are rare on purpose.** Don't restate what well-named code already says. Do comment a *why* that isn't obvious: a hidden invariant, a safety constraint around network selection, a workaround with a reference.
- **Never use the em-dash character** in code, comments, or docs. Rewrite the sentence (a comma, colon, or parentheses) instead.
- **Two trailing spaces** on consecutive bold-label markdown lines so CommonMark renders the line break instead of collapsing them.
- **Network safety matters.** Any change that touches network selection, configuration loading, or credential handling should come with a clear justification and appropriate test coverage.

---

## Commit messages

Match the existing log style: a concise subject line, then a short body explaining what changed and why.

- Branch off `master` and keep history linear (rebase, don't merge).
- One logical change per commit; don't batch unrelated work.
- **No `Co-Authored-By` trailers.** This is a project policy.
- **Never `--no-verify`.** If a hook fails, fix the cause; don't bypass it.

## Pull requests

CI is the smoke + unit gate. Before opening a PR:

1. Run the no-external-services tiers (`npm run ci`, `npm run test:security`) and confirm they pass.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a terse entry for your change.
3. Make sure `git status` is clean apart from intended changes (no `node_modules/`, no editor leftovers, no `.env`).
4. Open the PR with a clear title and a description of what changed and why.

For non-security bugs, open an issue at <https://github.com/XChain-platform/xchain-regtest-miner/issues/new>. For security bugs, see [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
